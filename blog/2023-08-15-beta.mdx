# State Backed is now in open beta and available for use

State Backed, the first platform to allow anyone to launch any state machine
as a persistent, reliable cloud actor, subscribe to real-time state updates
from anywhere, and send fully authorized events from any client or server,
is now available for use.

During this open beta period, we will not be charging clients for their usage
and are looking for feedback from the community as we strive to create the
nicest developer experience of any backend as a service platform.

Already, deploying a new machine consists of running a single command in our
[smply CLI](https://github.com/statebacked/smply) or using our in-browser
[IDE and flow visualizer](https://www.statebacked.dev).
Launching a new instance and connecting from the browser is just 3 substantive
lines of code:

```javascript
import { StateBackedClient } from "@statebacked/client";
import { useStateBackedMachine } from "@statebacked/react";
import { useActor } from "@xstate/react";

// Create an anonymous session.
// You can also easily create authenticated sessions using your existing identity provider,
// just by altering the config.
const client = new StateBackedClient({
  anonymous: {
    orgId: "org_YOUR-ORG-ID",
  }
});

function YourComponent() {
  const { actor } = useStateBackedMachine(
    client,
    {
      machineName: "your-machine",
      instanceName: "your-instance",
      getInitialContext() {
        return { "any": "initial-context" }
      }
    }
  );
  
  const [state, send] = useActor(actor);
  // render UI based on real-time updated state and send events
}
```

The traditional approaches to building backends are getting more and more cumbersome.
Having built a ton of these traditional backends ourselves, we're tired of pretending
that our individual endpoints or GraphQL resolvers are nicely decoupled bits of logic.
In reality, bundles of endpoints, whether you call them microservices or domains within
your monolith, are highly interdependent, with lots of assumptions baked into each about
the overall flow of state updates. We are, after all, building cohesive user experiences,
not merely APIs to be called in any order.

Pretending that these endpoints are decoupled only makes it more and more difficult to
piece together an understanding of the high-level flow that we actually care about.

We're confident that the better path forward is to treat flows as first-class entities
on the backend. That's what State Backed is about. You build a state machine that describes
the logic for a flow or set of flows you care about and deploy it as a single package
to the State Backed cloud. That means that you can always understand the most crucial aspects
of your app - the evolution of your state and triggering of external effects.
State Backed takes care of ensuring that you can launch as many instances of your flows as you
want, that each instance is persistent and durable, and that every state update and effect
creates a consistent, linearizable history for that machine instance.

And we forgot to mention: every instance creation, read request, and event you send is controled
by the simple authorization functions you provide as part of your deployment package, based
on the trusted user claims from your existing identity provider (or custom claims for
anonymous access or specialized us cases).

We've started building invincible workflows and real-time, multiplayer backends on top of
the platform (check out our [examples](https://docs.statebacked.dev/docs/examples)) and we're
super excited about the potential of applying this paradigm to these use cases.

You can deploy your first State Backed backend in less than five minutes at
[StateBacked.dev](https://www.statebacked.dev).

We'd love your [feedback](mailto:feedback@statebacked.dev)!
