# Introducing the State Backed UI

We're thrilled to release the [State Backed web UI](https://www.statebacked.dev)!

You now have two options to choose from to create machines, deploy versions, and administer
your State Backed account: the [`smply` CLI](https://github.com/statebacked/smply) and our 
brand new [web dashboard](https://www.statebacked.dev).

We still recommend using the `smply` CLI to connect your CI/CD environment and build pipelines
to State Backed but the web dashboard is really nice to quickly check in on your instances
and to tweak deployments.

We even included a full-blown in-browser IDE to easily author new machine versions.
We're not talking about an editor. We're talking `npm` and a command line right there
in your browser.

Check it out:

<div
    className="mt-16"
    style={{
        position: "relative",
        overflow: "hidden",
        width: "100%",
        paddingTop: "75%",
    }}
>
    <iframe
        style={{
        position: "absolute",
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        right: 0,
        bottom: 0,
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        }}
