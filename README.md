# State Backed Documentation

[State Backed](https://statebacked.dev) runs [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) state machines
as a service.

You write a simple state machine and State Backed allows you to create persistent, consistent instances
of it, fully secure and exposed via a simple API.

To get started, check out [our docs](https://docs.statebacked.dev).
